## Overview

We Ruin It Challenge made with Web-starter-kit and Bootstrap for Verto Homes Website.

Find it online at [http://moustachedesign.xyz/vertohomes.com/](http://moustachedesign.xyz/vertohomes.com/)

## Quickstart

There are two HTML starting points, from which you can choose:

- `index.html` - the default, containing the full website
- `basic.html` - no layout, but still includes our minimal mobile best-practices

## How to launch it
- Install NodeJS
- Navigate to the folder and type `npm install` (use sudo if on Linux/OSX)
- Run gulp to deploy the webapp and gulp serve to build and watch (or gulp serve:dist for distribution)

## Web Performance

Web Starter Kit strives to give you a high performance starting point out of the box. Our median Web Page Test [scores](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/151201_VW_XYC/) for the default template have a [Speed Index](https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/using-webpagetest/metrics/speed-index) of ~1100 (1000 is ideal) and a repeat-visit Speed Index of ~550 thanks to Service Worker precaching. 

## Inspiration

Web Starter Kit is inspired by [Mobile HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/mobile/) and Yeoman's [generator-gulp-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp), having taken input from contributors to both projects during development. Our [FAQs](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/wiki/FAQ) attempt to answer commonly asked questions about the project.
